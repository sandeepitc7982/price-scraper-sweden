## Finance Scraper

The finance scraper is an additional scraper that collects financial information about car models from the same automakers.
It gathers data such as vehicle details, pricing, and financing terms (e.g., monthly payments, interest rates) across multiple regions and markets. 
The collected data helps track and analyze the latest offers available in the automotive market, enabling better decision-making for both consumers and businesses.

This data is used to track various market offers from different car manufacturers (vendors) across multiple regions. The dataset is saved as part of the  `finance_options_filename` output.

Schema Details

**Intended Primary Key:**

* vehicle_id
* contract_type

Disclaimer:  We initially intended to use {unique_id, contract_type} as the primary key to ensure the uniqueness of each record. 
However, we encountered scenarios, particularly with OEMs like Audi, where the same car (vehicle_id) can appear with the same contract_type (e.g., PCP) in multiple rows.  
 
As a result, this key combination does not always maintain uniqueness, and we couldn't enforce it as the primary key without compromising the completeness of the data collection.
